# Fletching Table
Additions to fabric-loom

## Features
Currently the only thing it does is automates entrypoints for fabric mods.

Simply annotate a class, static method or field with `@Entrypoint` and specify the desired entrypoint to register to!

## Setup
Working on it! ~SHCM

## Planned
 - Dependency configuration to get loom-included jars out of resolved dependencies
 - Automatic Mixin registry
